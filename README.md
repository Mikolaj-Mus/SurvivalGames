# Survival Games Simulation

Welcome to the Survival Games Simulation! In this simple game, colorful champions move around a grid-based world. Each champ can move in four directions: up, down, left, and right. The main objective of the game is to eliminate other champs through battles. Champions with higher strength have better odds of winning fights. Fight outcomes are determined randomly, taking into account the strength of both champions.

## Features

- **Champion Movement**: Champions move across the grid in different directions, considering the borders and other champions' positions.
- **Fight System**: Champions engage in battles with adjacent opponents. The outcome is determined by the difference in strength and a random probability.
- **Strength Mechanism**: Victorious champs gain strength through fights, enhancing their chances in future battles.
- **Grid Dynamics**: Champions are confined by the grid's borders and adapt their movement strategies accordingly.
- **Interaction**: Use the Enter key to start the simulation, Space to pause, and Escape to exit.

## How to Play

1. Clone the repository to your local machine.
2. Compile and run the **'Mechanics.java'** file to start the simulation.
3. Press Enter to begin the game.
4. Observe champs moving, fighting, and growing stronger.
5. Press Space to pause the simulation and observe the state.
6. Press Escape to exit the simulation.

## Goal

The goal of this simulation is to provide an illustrative environment where champions compete and fight for survival. Experience the dynamics of the champions' interactions and see who emerges as the last champ standing!

Feel free to explore the code and modify parameters to experiment with different scenarios. Enjoy the Survival Games Simulation!
